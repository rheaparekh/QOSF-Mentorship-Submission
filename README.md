### QOSF Mentorship program screening task

Here, I am presenting a solution to screening task 2. I am using open source SDK Qiskit and Jupyter Notebook to present my solution.

## Notes

The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks depend on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
